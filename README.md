### 2. Beaver - LeetCode and MonkeyType Combination

Beaver is a fusion of LeetCode and MonkeyType, addressing the challenges faced by both platforms:

- 🧠 **LeetCode Issue:** Forgetting solutions to previously solved tasks.
- 💻 **MonkeyType Issue:** Difficulty in training to write code faster.

Beaver stores a dataset with data structures and algorithms, including solutions from LeetCode. It allows you to practice typing them in a MonkeyType fashion, keeping implementations in your short-term memory.

### 🎯 Tracking My Growth as a Developer

Over time, I've been actively working on projects to enhance my skills and contribute to various domains. Here's a snapshot of my progress:

#### [SomeTODOApp](https://github.com/nikitazigman/ToDoPetProject) | Sep. 2021
I initiated this project without a clear agenda, likely prompted by my exploration of Django through a book. It served as a practical exercise to reinforce my understanding of the framework.

#### [TaskAPI](https://github.com/nikitazigman/TaskApi) | Jan. 2023
A straightforward REST API created for my personal TODO Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, developed over a few days during my winter holidays.

#### [VideoService](https://github.com/nikitazigman/video_search_service) | Dec. 2023
A Graduation project for the Yandex Practicum course.
